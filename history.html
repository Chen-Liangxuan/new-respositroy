           <p>The Beatles performed for the first time at The Cavern Club at 10 Mathew Street, in Liverpool on February 9, 1961. Surprisingly, the show was a huge success despite the low audience. We gained more attention and were allowed to perform more often and there were more audiences to the point of tickets being pre-purchaased.</p>

             This gave the Beatles a boost in their popularity and we became widespread and started to tour. This also gave us the confidence to branch out into other countries such as the US
