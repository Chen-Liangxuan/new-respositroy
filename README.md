ID Project

Design Process

From a user standpoint, i would like to be able to find information on what i need easily and conviently.

Therefoore, I designed this website with the thoughts of the users who want to learn more about this band.
This website allows users to easily navigate to the information pages they want and the pages and supplemented with either videos or pictures on the information they need.
There are also instructions on how to use certain pages.
I think the website is very user friendly and people can easily find what they want.

Features
There is easy navigation to whatever page the user needs on desktop and mobile
The text and images will rescale depending on the user's device
There are easy to access links to videos and images relating to the band
There is a contact page for users to contact members of the band


Existing Features
Clicking on certain images such as the shows or contact page will bring the users to the page they need.
The website will rescale if the user is on a phone

Features Left to Implement
Sending direct feedback to the site owner without any staff.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

html was used to put the information into seperate accessible pages for the users
css was used to make the website look more formal, information and images to be organised and allows the user to navigate the pages easily with images/buttons
java was ued to make the navigation button when the user is on a phone and to close the navigation bar when the user navigates to a different page
